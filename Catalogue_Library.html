	<h1>Creating Library Records in the Catalogue</h1>
	<h2 class="tab">Description</h2>
	<p>EMu will not be used as a library catalog for the Carter's extensive library collection. EMu will instead be used to describe library objects housed in the vaults or used in exhibitions. This is primarily for tracking of objects. The database of record for library objects is the library catalog maintained in the library department, because of this the library records are not as detailed as art and archival records in EMu.</p>
	<figure class="quote"><blockquote><h2 class="tab">Instructions for using a record template in EMu</h2>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Check for Artist information</li>
	  <ul>
	  <li>You will need to know the IRN of the artist or author of the book, so you will need to go to the Parties Module prior to doing anything else.</li>
	  <li>Once you are in the Parties Module, search for the artist.</li>
	  <li>Write down the IRN on a sheet of paper. If the artist is not a part of the collection, a new Parties record will have to be created.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li>Find the last library object in sequence </li>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Open the Catalogue Module.</li>
	  <li>Search for LIB\* in the accession number field.</li>
	  <li>Sort the results by selecting HomeàSortàSort by accession number.</li>
	  <li>Scroll to the bottom of the search results and highlight the last record.</li>
	  </ul>
	<li>Use the Library Record Template</li>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Once you have highlighted that record, go to Tools-->Templates and select New Library record.</li>
	  <li>You will enter the number of records you wish to create in the first box. Please note that these records will be identical to one another with the exception of the accession number, so you will still have to edit the records in EMu if you choose to create multiple at once.</li>
	  <li>If the last LIB number used was 150, you will enter 151 into the box. It will use this number as the base accession numbers. If you enter 151 and said that you wanted 10 records, it would create new records with the accession numbers: LIB.151, LIB.152, LIB.154, etc.</li>
	  <li>Enter the title of the publication. Understand that for batch records, all works will be given this title.</li>
	  <li>Enter the date published. Follow art formatting: n.d. for no date, ca. for circa dates.</li>
	  <li>Earliest and Latest dates help with searching. If the date of a publication is 1975, the earliest and latest dates would be 1975. If the work has an uncertain date, you will follow the following guidelines:</li>
	  <li>Enter the medium as either “Book” or “Print”. Print mediums will be updated by Fernanda. </li>
	  <li>Enter the call number.</li>
	  <li>Enter the artist IRN, if you only have an author, enter the author IRN and change the role from “Artist” to “Author” in the record.</li>
	  <li>Enter the height of the print or book, record the numeric value only. </li>
	  <li>Enter the width of the print or book, record the numeric value only.</li>
	  <li>Confirm your information by clicking next. A window will popup with a report of your new records.</li>
	  </ul>
